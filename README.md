# Logic Node Editor


The Node-Based Python Tool is a software tool that provides a new way to organize reusable Python code. This tool is implemented in custom node classes that can be easily connected to one another to form a dynamic network.

The tool is designed to allow you to write Python code in individual files per class/node. This means that your code is self-contained, easily modifiable, and reusable across multiple projects. Additionally, the GUI for the Node-Based Python Tool is designed to be familiar to those who have used Unreal Engine's blueprinting system, making it easy to learn and use.

My goal with this project is to provide a new and innovative way of organizing and working with Python code. While the tool is still in the development phase, I am constantly working to improve its functionality and features.

I hope that you find the Node-Based Python Tool to be a valuable addition to your toolkit, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have as I continue to improve and expand its capabilities. Thank you for your interest in my project!
